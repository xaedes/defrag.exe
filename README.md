Watch defrag miraculously turning chaos into order at https://xaedes.github.io/defrag.exe/
Best served with a warm cup of coffee or tea.

## How to play

Fragment your disk first. Use the bulk ops or build a macro — try stacking a few
"Create+Delete cycle" and "Append all files" steps, then repeat it 10–20×
until fragmentation turns red.

Then pick a defrag mode, set speed to Slow, and watch the blocks find their way home.

## Defrag modes

- **Simple** — pack files tight, no reordering
- **Consolidate Free Space** — push all free blocks to the end
- **Sort by Filename** — alphabetical, very satisfying
- **Sort by Modification Date** — oldest files first
- **Sort by File Size** — largest files first
